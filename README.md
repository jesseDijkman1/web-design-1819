# Web Design - Jesse Dijkman
For this course we're going to design and make an accessible "component", like a date-picker, color-picker, or any other component that is relevant to our user. The user I'm going to design for is: Marijn Meijles. Marijn is spastic and can't use the web like the most of us. So I'm going to make something that is accessible for him and other people.

## Concept
My concept was a color-picker and it still is the main-component of my new concept (thanks to [Koop](https://github.com/KoopReynders)), which is a meme-maker. I don't know if Marijn is into memes, I hope so. But this seems like something that isn't accessible anywhere and can be made accessible.

## User Scenario
Marijn is at home looking at memes, he'd like to make a meme himself. But he want to make it with a keyboard. He just needs to upload (or refer to) an image and use it as a template. He can type the text and adjust their positions. He could also add rectangles and circles, and move them using his keyboard to adjust his meme. After he's done he needs to be able to download the meme.
